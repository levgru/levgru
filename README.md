### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on three main projects:
1. Working with Professor Lynn in the HMC physics department on entanglement witnessing.
2. A personal project on reproducing black holes on quantum computers.
3. A personal project on a tiktok-esque site but for reading summaries of academic papers.
